This is a catch-all directory for a project I'm calling Exocortex - a system
that spiders and indexes arbitrary data sources (Twitter timelines, RSS feeds,
and other online storehouses of personally interesting and useful information)
and makes it possible to search and extract information from them as needed.
This project is likely to be in alpha for a long time because it scratches
a couple of personal itches.

This is going to be a one in a while project for me, something that I work on
when I have a little time and need to do something different.  Please don't
treat this like the next new thing or the second coming of Alan Turing, I set
this Github project up so that there would be a remote repository that I
could fall back on.

Written in Python2.

Dependencies:
* SleekXMPP
* Tweepy?
