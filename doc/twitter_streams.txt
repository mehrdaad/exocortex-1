This is what Twitter streams look like when Tweepy pulls them.

For each tweet, use json.loads() to pull it into a hash table.

Here are some of the more useful keys in that hash table:
    * text - Full text of the tweet as a Unicode string.
    * coordinates - Map coordinates the tweet was posted from, if any.
    * user - Hash table containing who posted the tweet and their profile.
    * geo - Whether or not the account of origin has geotagging turned on.
    * created_at - Datestamp the tweet was posted.  Time is UTC.

tweet['user'] has the following interesting keys:
    * id_str - Account's internal ID as a string.
    * description - User's description.
    * location - User's stated location.
    * geo_enabled - Whether or not geotagging is enabled.
    * name - User's stated name.
    * screen_name - User's Twitter handle.
    * url - User's homepage URL, if given.
    * time_zone - User's time zone.
